Description
The Address Book is a web application designed to help users track and manage places they have visited. The application allows users to input the place name, location, date and time, landmarks, and notes about each place. The information is displayed in an organized table, and users can also mark tasks as done or remove entries.

Setup/Installation Requirements

Clone the repository or download the project files.

Open the index.html file in your browser to run the app.

No server or database is required. The application runs locally.

Optional Setup:

You can edit the script.js to modify functionalities or add new features.

Known Bugs
Currently, there is no functionality to edit existing entries.

If you remove a row from the table, it does not update the table automatically when the form is resubmitted.
